      <p2 style=font-family:arabic;color:blue>There I was, my first day in my new class.
         I was hella nervous, but I was confident, and the teacher was SUPER nice.
         His names was Professor Adams and he was the greatest teacher in my book.
         But that is beside the story.
         My first day was hectic but fun!
         He taught us a lot and helped us each step of the way.
         I even helped the class a little.
         A lot of what i learned help to make this possible.
         So visit the link obove so you can get started and have fun making your webpages.</p2>
